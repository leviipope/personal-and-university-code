% CSBOOTJACK	Jackknife-after-bootstrap
%
%	[BHAT,SEHATT,SEHATB,BVALS] = CSBOOTJACK(DATA,FNAME,B)
%
%	This function will return the bootstrap distribtuion for
%	a statistic given by FNAME.
%
%	X is an n x d array, where each row is an observation.
%	FNAME is a string for a MATLAB function that calculates a
%	statistic. The input argument to FNAME must be X only.
%	B is the number of bootstrap replicates. It is recommended that
%	this number be greater than 1000.
%	BHAT is the bootstrap estimate of bias of the statistic FNAME.
%	SEHATT is the bootstrap estimate of the variance of the statistic FNAME.
%	VARHATB is the bootstrap estimate of the standard error in the estimate of SEHATT.
%	BVALS is the vector of bootstrap replicates.
%
%	See also CSBOOT, CSJACK
%
%	Example: 	x = randn(50,1);
%				[bhat,sehatT,varhatB,bvals] = csbootjack(x,'mean',1000);
%				[bhat,sehatT,varhatB,bvals] = csbootjack(x,'myfun',1000);
